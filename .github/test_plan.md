- [ ] `Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal`
  - [ ] Right-click
  - [ ] Command
  - [ ] `Shift+Enter`

#### Virtual environments

**ALWAYS**:
- Use the latest version of Anaconda
- Realize that `conda` is slow
- Create an environment with a space in their path somewhere as well as upper and lowercase characters
- Make sure that you do not have `python.pythonPath` specified in your `settings.json` when testing automatic detection
- Do note that the `Select Interpreter` drop-down window scrolls

- [ ] Detected a single virtual environment at the top-level of the workspace folder on Mac when when `python` command points to default Mac Python installation or `python` command fails in the terminal.
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
- [ ] Detected a single virtual environment at the top-level of the workspace folder on Windows when `python` fails in the terminal.
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
- [ ] Detected a single virtual environment at the top-level of the workspace folder
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
  - [ ] [`Create Terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_activating-an-environment-in-the-terminal) works
    - [ ] Steals focus
    - [ ] `"python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false` deactivates automatically running the activation script in the terminal
  - [ ] After the language server downloads it is able to complete its analysis of the environment w/o requiring a restart
- [ ] Detect multiple virtual environments contained in the directory specified in `"python.venvPath"`
- [ ] Detected all [conda environments created with an interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_conda-environments)
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(condaenv)`)
  - [ ] Prompted to install Pylint
    - [ ] Asked whether to install using conda or pip
    - [ ] Installs into environment
  - [ ] [`Create Terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_activating-an-environment-in-the-terminal) works
    - [ ] `"python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false` deactivates automatically running the activation script in the terminal
  - [ ] After the language server downloads it is able to complete its analysis of the environment w/o requiring a restart
- [ ] (Linux/macOS until [`-m` is supported](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/978)) Detected the virtual environment created by [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(pipenv)`)
  - [ ] Prompt to install Pylint uses `pipenv install --dev`
  - [ ] [`Create Terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_activating-an-environment-in-the-terminal) works
    - [ ] `"python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false` deactivates automatically running the activation script in the terminal
  - [ ] After the language server downloads it is able to complete its analysis of the environment w/o requiring a restart
- [ ] (Linux/macOS) Virtual environments created under `{workspaceFolder}/.direnv/python-{python_version}` are detected (for [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and its [`layout python3`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/stdlib.sh) support)
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
- [ ] Installed requests in app virtual environments and detect import error disappeared
    - [ ] Prompt unresolver import 'requests'
    - [ ] Create Terminal works to create app virtual environment uses py -3 -m venv env 
    - [ ] Install requests in terminal uses pip install reuqests   

#### [Environment files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_environment-variable-definitions-file)
Sample files:
```python
# example.py
import os
print('Hello,', os.environ.get('WHO'), '!')
```
```
# .env
WHO=world
PYTHONPATH=some/path/somewhere
SPAM='hello ${WHO}'
````

**ALWAYS**:
- Make sure to use `Reload Window` between tests to reset your environment
- Note that environment files only apply under the debugger and Jedi

- [ ] Environment variables in a `.env` file are exposed when running under the debugger
- [ ] `"python.envFile"` allows for specifying an environment file manually (e.g. Jedi picks up `PYTHONPATH` changes)
- [ ] `envFile` in a `launch.json` configuration works
- [ ] simple variable substitution works

#### [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_python-interpreter-for-debugging)

- [ ] `pythonPath` setting in your `launch.json` overrides your `python.pythonPath` default setting

### [Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)

**ALWAYS**:
- Check under the `Problems` tab to see e.g. if a linter is raising errors

#### Pylint/default linting
[Prompting to install Pylint is covered under `Environments` above]

For testing the disablement of the default linting rules for Pylint:
```ini
# pylintrc
[MESSAGES CONTROL]
enable=bad-names
```
```python3
# example.py
foo = 42  # Marked as a blacklisted name.
```
- [ ] Installation via the prompt installs Pylint as appropriate
  - [ ] Uses `--user` for system-install of Python
  - [ ] Installs into a virtual environment environment directly
- [ ] Pylint works
- [ ] `"python.linting.pylintUseMinimalCheckers": false` turns off the default rules w/ no `pylintrc` file present
- [ ] The existence of a `pylintrc` file turns off the default rules

#### Other linters

**Note**:
- You can use the `Run Linting` command to run a newly installed linter
- When the extension installs a new linter, it turns off all other linters

- [ ] prospector works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] pydocstyle works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] pylama works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] 3 or more linters work simultaneously (make sure you have turned on the linters in your `settings.json`)
  - [ ] `Run Linting` runs all activated linters
  - [ ] `"python.linting.enabled": false` disables all linters
  - [ ] The `Enable Linting` command changes `"python.linting.enabled"`
- [ ] `"python.linting.lintOnSave` works

### [Editing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing)

#### [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_autocomplete-and-intellisense)

Please also test for general accuracy on the most "interesting" code you can find.

- [ ] `"python.autoComplete.extraPaths"` works
- [ ] `"python.autocomplete.addBrackets": true` causes auto-completion of functions to append `()`
- [ ]  requests auto-completions works
- [ ]  Documentation/parameters shows for "open" method
- [ ]  Completions show for "request."

#### [Formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting)
Sample file:
```python
# There should be _some_ change after running `Format Document`.
import os,sys;
def foo():pass
```

- [ ] Prompted to install a formatter if none installed and `Format Document` is run
  - [ ] Installing `autopep8` works
  - [ ] Installing `black` works
  - [ ] Installing `yapf` works
- [ ] Formatters work with default settings (i.e. `"python.formatting.provider"` is specified but not matching `*Path`or `*Args` settings)
  - [ ] autopep8
  - [ ] black
  - [ ] yapf
- [ ] Formatters work when appropriate `*Path` and `*Args` settings are specified (use absolute paths; use `~` if possible)
  - [ ] autopep8
  - [ ] black
  - [ ] yapf
- [ ] `"editor.formatOnType": true` works and has expected results

#### [Refactoring](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_refactoring)

- [ ] [`Extract Variable`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_extract-variable) works
  - [ ] You are prompted to install `rope` if it is not already available
- [ ] [`Extract method`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_extract-method) works
  - [ ] You are prompted to install `rope` if it is not already available
- [ ] [`Sort Imports`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_sort-imports) works

#### Send code to terminal to execute
Sample file:
	import requests
	request = requests.get("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1_9On2-nsBQIw3JiY43sWbrF8EjrqrR4U")
	with open("survey2017.zip", "wb") as file:
      file.write(request.content)
  import zipfile
	with zipfile.ZipFile('survey2017.zip') as zip:
	zip.extractall('survey2017')
	import shutil, os
	shutil.move('survey2017/survey_results_public.csv','survey2017.csv')
	shutil.rmtree('survey2017')
